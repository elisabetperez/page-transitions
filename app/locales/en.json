Climate change alone—beyond the effect of pollution or zoonotic diseases—is expected to have significant effects on mortality. By 2100 the number of estimated deaths associated with climate change (in a scenario with very high GHG emissions)  could be comparable to some of the leading deaths causes today (figure 3).",

More people, in more places, are experiencing some variation of conflict, and a majority of the global population feel worried about violence. Chapter 4 aims to center conflict analysis on people, rather than on the contestations. Taking well established conflict-definitions as a starting point, it expands the analysis to look at compounding human security threats and people living in conflict-affected areas. In doing so it shows how a new generation of human security, based on protection, empowerment and solidarity can shed light on blind-spots support the building of just and peaceful societies.",

Inequalities in human dignity are not just a moral issue but they are globally disestablishing, having direct and practical effects on human development. Chapter 5 dives into the different experiences of horizontal inequalities linked to the overlapping identities. It describes the importance of perceiving humans as agents, not victims, when analyzing the way different social groups experience challenges to human security and structural causes that can lead to discrimination and violence of these groups. And a focus on agency shows how eliminating horizontal inequalities not only is a matter of justice for those discriminated against or excluded, but also enriches communities and society more broadly, because agency is central for broader processes of social change. An agency-focused approach also recognizes that people hold multiple identities at once. That people are simultaneously members of different collectives provides for solidarity to be built across groups over shared values and goals. A foundation of agency enhances space for solidarity as people are better able to reason about, strategize and participate in actions that transform society.",

Chapter 6 explores this gap between health threats and healthcare systems’ ability to meet them. To measure the extent to which healthcare systems can be characterized as universal, the report introduces a new Healthcare Universalism Index (HUI). The HUI which is based on a comprehensive concept of universalism, comprised not only on effective coverage but also of two additional components: generosity and equity. The HUI has improved over time: between 1995 and 2017 the world's HUI increasing by almost 8 points. But gaps in universalism between different HDI groups are widening on average (figure 8).",
                "p_5": "The chapter then covers the uneven recovery from COVID-19, the evolving burden on healthcare systems, how poor healthcare systems foster human insecurity, and the opportunity to create a new generation of human security through universalism. Re-evaluating and reforming health systems with a human security lens reveals that healthcare systems are among the most promising spaces for advancing a new generation of human security strategies."
